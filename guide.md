### Tabs

#### Naming Tab

- **Show Name**: The general series name. Use `$show$` in templates to reference this name.

### Using the TMDB, TVDB, and Custom Titles Dialogs

#### TMDB Dialog (Configure TMDB...)

This dialog allows you to fetch episode titles and metadata from The Movie Database (TMDB).

**Fields and Options:**

- **Enable TMDB Integration**: Toggle TMDB metadata fetching on or off.
- **This is a Movie (not a TV series)**: Check if muxing a movie instead of a TV show.
- **TMDB ID**: Enter the numeric TMDB ID for the show or movie. You can find this on the TMDB website.
- **Season Number**: For TV shows, specify the season to fetch episode data from.
- **Episode Number Offset**: Add this number to the episode number parsed from the filename (useful for specials or split seasons).
- **Episode Order**: Choose the episode order (Aired, DVD, Absolute, etc.).
- **Language**: Set the language code (e.g., `en-US`, `de`).
- **Use episode number from filename**: If checked, the episode number is parsed from the filename; otherwise, uses the fileâ€™s position in the list.
- **Metadata Options**: Choose which metadata to write (title, IDs, release date, cover art, series summary, episode synopsis).
- **Replace Spaces In Title With**: Replace spaces in titles with a custom character (e.g., `.` or `_`).
- **Title Sanitization Rules**: Add rules to replace or remove specific characters from titles.

**Tips:**

- If you get no results, double-check the TMDB ID and season number.
- Use the language code that matches your preferred episode titles.

---

#### TVDB Dialog (Configure TVDB...)

This dialog allows you to fetch episode titles and metadata from The TV Database (TVDB).

**Fields and Options:**

- **Enable TVDB Integration**: Toggle TVDB metadata fetching on or off.
- **API Key**: Enter your TVDB v4 API key. You can get this from your TVDB account.
- **Show ID**: Enter the numeric TVDB show ID (found in the TVDB URL for the show).
- **Season Number**: Specify the season to fetch episode data from.
- **Episode Number Offset**: Add this number to the episode number parsed from the filename.
- **Metadata Options**: Choose which metadata to write (episode title, IDs, release date, cover art, episode summary, series summary).

**Tips:**

- You must have a valid TVDB API key. If you get errors, check your key and show ID.
- If cover art is not appearing, ensure "Download & Embed Cover Art" is enabled and you are connected to the internet.
- Use the correct season number for the episodes you are muxing.
- **Note:** The TVDB integration only supports the aired order for episodes. DVD, absolute order, and director's cut are not supported.

**Example TVDB Template Usage:**

- **Basic naming**: `$seriesname - S$season$E$ep$ - $episodenameext`
- **With air date**: `$seriesname ($airyear) - S$season$E$ep$ - $episodenameext`
- **Anime format**: `$seriesname - $absolutenumber - $episodenameext`
- **With network**: `[$seriesnetwork] $seriesname - S$season$E$ep$ - $episodenameext`
- **Detailed**: `$seriesname - S$season$E$ep$ - $episodename [$seriesgenres]$ext`

---

#### Custom Titles Dialog (Set Custom Titles...)

This dialog lets you manually specify a list of titles for each episode or file, overriding automatic fetching.

**How to Use:**

- **MKV Titles Tab**: Enter one MKV title per line. These will be applied in order to the muxed files.
- **Filename Titles Tab**: Enter one filename episode value per line. These will replace `$ep$` in the filename template sequentially.

**Tips:**

- Use this if TMDB/TVDB does not have the correct episode titles or you want custom naming.
- The order of lines matters: the first line is used for the first file, the second for the second, etc.
- Leave a line blank to skip a title for that episode.

---

**Troubleshooting:**

- If metadata is not being applied, ensure the integration is enabled and all required fields (API keys, IDs) are filled in.
- For cover art issues, check your internet connection and that the cover art option is enabled.
- If custom titles are not appearing, make sure the dialog is saved and the preset is updated.

- **Pattern Detection**: Looks for lines with the specific format:

  - Starts with a dash (`-`) followed by first speaker's text
  - Contains `\N` (line break)
  - Followed by another dash (`-`) and second speaker's text
  - Preserves formatting tags like `{\i1}` at the start of each speaker's line

  - **Second part (after \N)**: The text after `\N` gets the Alt style (different color)
  - **First part (before \N)**: The text before `\N` gets the Alt style

- **Style Creation**: Automatically creates an "Alt" style if it doesn't exist:

  - Based on the original line's style
  - Uses custom colors: white text, red secondary, brown outline, transparent shadow
  - Applied to the designated second speaker

- **Timing**: Both lines use the same start and end times (true overlapping dialogue)

- **Use Cases**:

  - Converting single lines with dual speakers into proper overlapping dialogue
  - Creating visually distinct speakers in simultaneous conversations
  - Improving readability of back-and-forth dialogue

- **Run Split**: Execute the split overlap operation on all selected files
